\section{The Committee}

\begin {enumerate}
  
  \item All office-bearers shall be subject to election annually.

  \item The President, Secretary and Treasurer of the society shall be matriculated students of The University of Edinburgh.

  \item Elected committee positions are as follows:-
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The President shall be ultimately responsible for the conduct of the society
      \item The Secretary shall be responsible to the President for the administration of the society
      \item The Treasurer shall be responsible to the President for the finances of the society
      \item Society office bearers will attend annual society training as outlined by the Societies Team
      \item Other elected positions on the committee may be Vice President, Hack Secretary, Social
        Secretary, Technical Secretary, Second Year Representative, 
        Third Year Representative and Fourth Year Representative.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item The year representatives must be students which will be enrolled in that year the semester 
    following the AGM. At the time of the AGM the Second Year Representative should be a first year, etc.
  
  \item The First Year (Freshers') Representative is a special case and will be elected at the first STMU (Or EGM)
    in the first semester before the end of October. If the position is not filled the committee may select a
    willing first year or hold subsequent re-elections.

  \item The following are guidelines as to what role the person in these positions shall have in the society:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The Vice President shall oversee and work with the SIGs as well as
        being responsible for the STMUs (Finding speakers and handling venues).
      \item The committee may find volunteers responsible for promotional materials
        being made for events. The Secretary shall be ultimately
        responsible for news and updates being posted to the website and
        maintaining any social networks CompSoc may have a presence on,
        although this may be delegated to others if the Secretary feels this
        would be beneficial.
      \item The Secretary is also ultimately responsible for the creation of any
        society apparel such as hoodies, although this may be delegated to others
        if the Secretary feels this would be beneficial. The Social Secretary
        shall be responsible for booking venues (Other than STMU related venues 
        and Hackathon related venues) for and running the societies
        official events.
      \item The Year Representatives shall be responsible for communicating to
        and promoting the society to students in their year.
      \item The Hack Secretary shall be responsible for organising and assembling 
        an organisation team/SIG for any hackathons the committee wishes to run.
      \item The Technical Secretary shall be responsible for maintaining any servers
        and services that the society is running for both the committee and members.
        The Tech Sec will also be responsible for any technical setups for society events.
    \end{enumerate}

    It is important to note that the above are suggestions to what those elected
    to the positions should be responsible, not absolute rules. Delegation is
    encouraged and necessary, but those in the relevant positions should take
    responsibility for delegating the tasks and making sure they get done.
    
    \item Non elected positions on the committee are as follows:-
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item To ensure cooperation between the School of Informatics and CompSoc,
          the school-representatives for the school of informatics automatically
          have a place and vote on the committee. It is entirely up to
          the representative to what degree he or she wants to participate in
          the committee.
        \item The leaders of the Special Interest Groups have a place and vote on
          the committee (see below, ”Special Interest Groups”)
      \end{enumerate}

    \item The committee may find it helpful to appoint members to additional positions
      on the committee after the elections. These must be co-opted onto the committee by a two
      third majority of the current committee.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Special Interest Groups (SIGs)}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Any member of CompSoc may, and is encouraged to, start a special interest
    group pertaining to any common interest the members may have.
    What follows are guidelines on the rights and rules regarding SIGs.

  \item When forming a new SIG a request should be handed in to the committee
    outlining the main goals and purpose of the SIG.

  \item The following points will be considered by the committee when processing
    the application of a new SIG:-
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The SIG should have a clearly defined goal, purpose or other reason
      for existence deemed appropriate by the committee.
      \item The SIG should have at least 4 members. In extraordinary circumstances
      this can be overruled by the vote of 2/3 of the committee.
      \item The SIG should have current CompSoc-member as a leader. The
      leader shall be responsible for running the group and reporting back
      to the Vice President and the CompSoc committee. It is encouraged
      that the selection of a leader should be done democratically within the
      group.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item New SIGs must be approved by two thirds of the committee.

  \item Once an SIG is accepted:-
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The leader of any accepted SIG will automatically have a seat and a
        vote on the CompSoc committee.
      \item is entirely up to the SIG how it wants to handle signing up members,
        arranging meetings or other matters pertaining to the general
        administration of the SIG.
      \item The SIG has the right to receive support from the committee within
        reason, including but not limited to financial support, creation of
        advertising materials and free promotion on the CompSoc website,
        newsletter and Facebook-group. Requests for such support should
        be given in writing to the committee.
      \item The leader of an SIG should continuously keep the committee informed
        of the activities of the SIG.
    \end{enumerate}

    
  \item If the committee feels an SIG’s activities has become incompatible with
    the interests and aims of the society, the committee may, by a two third
    majority, decide to dis-associate CompSoc from the SIG.

  \subsection{Leadership of SIGs}

  \item The choice of a leader should be entirely up the SIG. If a major dispute
    about leadership of an SIG is brought to the attention of the committee, a
    member of the committee will temporarily act as a leader for the SIG and
    attempt to find a solution. If no agreement is made within a reasonable
    amount of time the committee may choose to appoint a leader, or decide
    to dis-credit the SIG.

  \item When an SIG gets a new leader the change in leadership should be reported
    to the committee by the old leader.

  \subsection{Special Cases}

  \item Note that the above are guidelines which should be followed in the general
    case. In some instances it will be impractical for an SIG to follow the
    above rules. This may include external groups or clubs with a university
    division that wishes to associate itself with CompSoc or on-campus groups
    associated with larger tech-companies. In these cases it will be entirely
    at the committee’s discretion how the relationship between the SIG and
    CompSoc will work. The SIG will still require a two third majority of the
    committee to be approved.

\end{enumerate}

\newpage{}
\section{AGM}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Before the AGM the committee shall provide a document which outlines
    the activities and events which took place since the last AGM. This document
    should give members attending the AGM an insight into the activities
    of the society and give the new committee a guide to what they
    should go on to do in their term.

        voted on.
      \item The amended constitution must be passed with a two third majority
        at the general meeting.
    \end{enumerate}
    
  \item When elections are held there will always be an option to re-open nominations.
    This option will be presented as an additional candidate, “Ron”.
    If Ron gets the greatest amount of votes the position will be kept open
    and an EGM shall be called by the committee to fill the position. There
    will not be a “Ron” candidate for the positions of President, Secretary,
    Treasurer. Nominations may be made at the AGM, subject to the nominee's
    consent.

  \item If no nominations are received for any of President, Secretary or Treasurer,
    the incumbent committee shall call an EGM within 4 weeks. If all 3
    positions are not filled following an EGM, the incumbent committee shall
    inform EUSA that the society has become defunct. Anybody can reform
    the society by contacting EUSA, however this must be done within 3 years
    or all society assets will be lost.
