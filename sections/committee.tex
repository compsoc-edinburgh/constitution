  \end{enumerate}

\item The year representatives must be students which will be enrolled in that year the semester following the AGM\@. At the time of the AGM the Second Year Representative should be a first year, etc.

\item The following are guidelines as to what role the person in these positions shall have in the society:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The Vice President shall oversee and work with the SIGs as well as being responsible for the STMUs (Finding speakers and handling venues).
  \item The committee may find volunteers responsible for promotional materials being made for events. The Secretary shall be ultimately responsible for news and updates being posted to the website and maintaining any social networks CompSoc may have a presence on, although this may be delegated to others if the Secretary feels this would be beneficial.
  \item The Secretary is also ultimately responsible for the creation of any society apparel such as hoodies, although this may be delegated to others if the Secretary feels this would be beneficial.

  \item The EDI (equality, diversity and inclusion) Officer shall be responsible for ensuring that the society is inclusive and welcoming to all students, and that the society is accessible to all students.
  \end{enumerate}

  It is important to note that the above are suggestions to what those elected to the positions should be responsible, not absolute rules. Delegation is encouraged and necessary, but those in the relevant positions should take responsibility for delegating the tasks and making sure they get done.

\item Non elected positions on the committee are as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item To ensure cooperation between the School of Informatics and CompSoc, the school convenors for the School of Informatics automatically have a place and vote on the committee, to vote on behalf of the school. It is entirely up to the representative to what degree they wish to participate in the committee.
  \item The leaders of the Special Interest Groups have a place and vote on the committee (see below, \enquote{Special Interest Groups}).
  \end{enumerate}

\item The committee may find it helpful to appoint members to additional positions on the committee after the elections. These must be co-opted onto the committee by a two third majority of the current committee.

\item In the event of ambiguity or contradiction within this constitution, a quorate committee may vote, by simple majority, to settle any disputes.

\end{enumerate}
